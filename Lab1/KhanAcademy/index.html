        <p> Hello guys! Welcome to Introduction to Web Development.</p>

        <h2> HTML </h2>
        <p> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language 
            for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and 
            structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as 
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

        <h2> CSS </h2>
        <p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation 
            and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects 
            such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>

        <h2> JavaScript </h2>
        <p> JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, 
            alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, 
            often incorporating third-party libraries.</p>
